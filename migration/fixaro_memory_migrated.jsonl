{"content": "Fixaro URL Structure Migration - 2025-11-02. Successfully implemented complete SEO URL structure migration for Fixaro. New URL pattern: /{lang}/professionals/{country}/{city}/{service}/ and /{lang}/jobs/{country}/{city}/{service}/. Renamed routes: /professionals/[id]/ → /professional/[slug]/ and /jobs/[jobId]/ → /job/[slug]/ to avoid route conflicts. Created 10 new route pages with ISR (300s revalidation), generateStaticParams, and generateMetadata. Implemented 301 redirects in middleware.ts for old URL structure. Updated sitemap.ts with dynamic URL generation for all country/city/service combinations. Created Breadcrumbs component with Schema.org BreadcrumbList structured data. Added IRONCLAD rules to CLAUDE.md: URL structure is immutable for SEO, requires 301 redirects for any changes. Build stats: 4510 static pages generated in 35.6s. Deployed to both dev.fixaro.pro and fixaro.pro (production). Performance: Page load 1076ms, Full load 2096ms (both within targets).

Code Review checks: logic, security, performance, patterns, best practices (CRITICAL/MAJOR/MINOR severity). Created Checklist Pattern: docs/patterns/CHECKLIST_PATTERN.md (for tasks >5 subtasks). Checklist provides: visual progress, systematic tracking, nothing missed, time tracking. Created Error Handling Patterns: docs/patterns/ERROR_HANDLING_PATTERNS.md (standardized errors). Error types: AppError, ValidationError, NotFoundError, UnauthorizedError, DatabaseError, etc.. Integrated Code Review into workflow: Phase 2.5 (after sub-agents, before QA). Updated CLAUDE.md: Phase 2.5 Code Review mandatory for >5 agents. Updated docs/workflows/QA_WORKFLOW.md: Added Phase 2.5, updated diagram, updated example. Updated PM Agent: Added checklist pattern for >5 subtasks with template.
